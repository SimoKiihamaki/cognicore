# CogniCore Implementation Progress

## Project Overview
CogniCore is a lightweight, privacy-focused note-taking and knowledge management application that runs entirely in the browser. It leverages client-side storage (IndexedDB and LocalStorage) and integrates with a locally hosted LLM (via LM Studio) to provide an AI-powered note organization and querying experience. The application uses sentence embeddings and cosine similarity to establish relationships between notes, ensuring that all data remains local to the user's machine for maximum privacy.

## Technical Details

### Frontend Architecture
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- React Router for client-side navigation
- ShadCN UI components for modern, dark-themed interface
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling

### Data Storage

5. ✅ Enhance MCP server integration and authentication
6. ✅ Implement export/import functionality for notes and embeddings
7. ✅ Add web worker support for non-blocking embedding generation
8. ✅ Implement caching mechanisms for embeddings and similarity calculations

### Secondary Priorities
1. ✅ Develop more advanced LM Studio configuration options
2. ✅ Implement advanced theme customization
3. ❌ Add local collaborative editing features
4. ❌ Implement shared workspace support
5. ❌ Add revision history tracking

## Conclusion
The CogniCore project has made significant progress in implementing core features like LM Studio integration, MCP server support, and embedding-based similarity detection. The application now has a fully functional UI with all major components implemented.

Recent improvements include:
1. A comprehensive caching system that significantly improves application performance by storing frequently accessed embeddings and similarity calculations
2. Web worker-based embedding generation that moves computationally intensive operations off the main thread, ensuring a smooth user experience
3. Advanced MCP knowledge integration with smart matching and organization
4. Enhanced embedding management with model selection and comprehensive progress reporting
5. Complete import/export functionality with support for various formats and granular options
6. Advanced LM Studio configuration with model presets, parameter controls, and connection management
7. Comprehensive theme customization with presets, color controls, and UI density adjustments

The system now provides efficient cache management with automatic cleanup, cache invalidation when content changes, and a user interface for monitoring and controlling cache usage. The embedding system has been optimized with web workers to prevent UI blocking during computation-intensive operations. 

The new advanced theme system allows users to select from predefined themes (including styles inspired by Discord, Obsidian, and Cursor), create custom themes with full color palette customization, and adjust UI density. Similarly, the enhanced LM Studio configuration provides detailed control over model parameters (temperature, top-p, top-k, max tokens), supports both local and API connection modes, and includes presets for popular open-source and proprietary models.

These improvements ensure the application remains responsive even when working with large datasets or performing complex calculations, while also providing users with extensive customization options to tailor the experience to their preferences.

With all planned enhancements for theme customization and LM Studio configuration now completed, the project can focus on future priorities like potential collaborative features when needed.
